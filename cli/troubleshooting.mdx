## Not authenticated with Fly.io

Error:

```text
Not authenticated with Fly.io. Please run:
  fly auth login
```

Fix:

```bash
fly auth login
fly orgs list
```

## Fly CLI not found

During `fare init`, the CLI can install or fix Fly CLI permissions. If it fails, install manually:

- macOS: `brew install flyctl`
- Linux: `curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh`
- Windows: `powershell -Command "iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex"`

## Invalid casino name

Rules: lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens; 3–30 chars; cannot start/end with `-`.

## App not found on Fly.io

If `status` or `logs` says the app is missing, deploy first:

```bash
fare deploy
```

## Logs stop streaming

If you see a message about signals, it usually indicates Ctrl+C was pressed. Re-run `fare logs`.
